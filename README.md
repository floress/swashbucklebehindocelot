# Swashbuckle Behind Ocelot
An approach to middleware for Open Api Specification

The idea is to catch the requests of index.html and swagger.json of Swashbuckle user interface and rewrite them.

It's only for development environments. It doesn't require any specific configuration on the webserver or reverse proxy.
